# Take opencode.ai codebase as reference

OPENCODE.ai from https://github.com/sst/opencode.git is checkout to `opencode/` folder besides workspace folder, 
look into that directory for reference and copy their code for reuse as appropriate.

../opencode/packages/opencode is their backend implementation
../opencode/packages/tui is their TUI implementation
../opencode/packages/web is the source of their product documentation as static web site
../opencode/packages/app is their experimental/incomplete WebUI implementation

Note that opencode uses `bun` as packager and Go as TUI implementation language, 
while we stick to nodejs, TypeScript, and `pnpm`.
